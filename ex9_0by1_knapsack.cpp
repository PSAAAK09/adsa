Write a program to solve 0/1 Knapsack problem Using Dynamic Programming

AIM: -   To Perform Write a program to solve 0/1 Knapsack problem Using Dynamic Programming.

THEORY: 

The 0/1 Knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem where you are given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and a knapsack with a maximum weight capacity. The goal is to determine the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting a subset of the items such that the total weight does not exceed the knapsackâ€™s capacity.
Program Explanation
Input Parameters:
W: Maximum weight capacity of the knapsack.
wt: A vector containing the weights of the items.
val: A vector containing the values of the items.
n: The number of items.
Dynamic Programming Table:
We use a 2D vector dp where dp[i][w] represents the maximum value that can be obtained with the first i items and a knapsack capacity of w.
Initialization:
The table dp is initialized with zeros. This represents the base case where either the number of items is zero or the capacity of the knapsack is zero, resulting in a maximum value of zero.
Filling the Table:
We iterate through each item and each possible weight capacity.
For each item i and weight w:
If the weight of the current item wt[i-1] is less than or equal to w, we have two choices
Include the item: The value is val[i-1] plus the maximum value obtained with the remaining capacity w - wt[i-1].
Exclude the item: The value is the maximum value obtained without including the current item.
We take the maximum of these two choices and store it in dp[i][w].
If the weight of the current item is greater than w, we cannot include the item, so the value remains the same as without the item.
Result:
The value in dp[n][W] represents the maximum value that can be obtained with the given items and knapsack capacity.
